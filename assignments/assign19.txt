Write a program that declares variables to hold
- the number of shots on goal per period of a game
- the number of saves per period of a game

Fill in the data and then use it to determine a goalie's overall save percentage and save percentage by period.

Display the overall save percentage. Then, for each period display the save percentage. Place a * next to the save percentage when it is 90% or better.

Here is an example of the output:

Period 1 Save Percentage: 83% (20/24)
Period 2 Save Percentage: *94% (15/16)
Period 3 Save Percentage: *100% (20/20)

Overall Save Percentage: *92% (55/60)
