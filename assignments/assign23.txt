Write a program that reads in some data from a file called goalies.txt and calculates each one's save percentage.

This is similar to a previous program but in that case the data was hard coded into the program.

In this one, read in the file and then separate the goalie data before calculating the save percentages.

Use functions so that you don't have one huge loop.

function printStats(goalieFirstName, goalieLastName, savesArray) {

}
