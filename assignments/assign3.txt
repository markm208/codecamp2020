Write a program (in a new folder with a file called main.js) that calculates how many years until you graduate college and what year that will be. 
- Create variables to hold:
  -- your name
  -- your current grade number (8, 10)
  -- the current year number (2020)
- Then calculate and store in a variable
  -- the number of years until graduate
  -- the year when that will happen
Print the name, number of years until graduation, and what year it will be when that happens
