Write a program that allows the user to enter in a day number (1-365) and prints out the month name and day number of that month. If the user enters in 59 the program should print out:
 
Day 59 is February 28
 
If the user enters an invalid day number display an error message and end the program.
 
Use an array of integers to hold the number of days in each of the months. Use the array to keep a running sum to help with your day calculations. 
 
//number of days in each of the months
let numDaysInMonths = [31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31];

//names of the months
let monthNames = ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June', 'July', 'August', 'September', 'October', 'November', 'December'];

//day number to calculate a date for
let dayNumber = 59;

//what other variables do you need??
