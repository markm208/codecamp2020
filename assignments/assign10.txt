Create two array variables:
- an array with all of the month names (strings)
- an array with the number of whole days in each month (integers)

Then, use the arrays to verify whether a date is valid or not. If the date is valid print out the month name , date, and year like this: "March 19, 1973". If it is not valid print out an error message like "Invalid Date".

Create variables for the inputs:
let monthNumber = 3;
let dayNumber = 19; //what if I put in 32 here? That is an invalid date!
let yearNumber = 1973;

Use the arrays and an if/else statement to determine if the date is valid.

Hint: Here are the number of days in each of the months
January 31
February 28
March 31
April 30
May 31
June 30
July 31
August 31
September 30
October 31
November 30
December 31
