Write a function called isPrime() that takes a number and returns true if the number is prime and false if it is not (you can use any old code that you have if you think it will help).

function isPrime(numToCheck) {
    //code to determine if the number numToCheck is prime

    //return a true or false value
}

Next, write some code that calls it repeatedly to print all of the primes between 2 - 1000.
