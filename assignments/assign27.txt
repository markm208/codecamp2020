Part 1
Create a class that represents a dictionary. The dictionary will read in words 
from a file (the file will hold words in alphabetical order) and allow the 
user of the class to search to see if a word is present in the collection of 
words.
 
The class should have a constructor that takes the path to a dictionary file 
and should include a method called search() that takes a word to search for 
and returns either a true or false. Since the words will be in order when 
they are read from the file you should attempt to use the binary search 
algorithm we talked about in class.
 
Write a driver program to create an instance of the class and use it to search 
for words in your dictionary file like this:

let dictionary = new Dictionary('bigDictionary.txt');

let testWords = ['cattle', 'mob', 'efzrutwoa', 'wqqw'];
for(let i = 0;i < testWords.length;i++) {
    if(dictionary.search(testWords[i])) {
        console.log(`The word ${testWords[i]} was found in the dictionary`);
    } else {
        console.log(`The word ${testWords[i]} was NOT found in the dictionary`);
    }
}

Part 2
Extend the dictionary class from part 1 to create a spellchecker. The new dictionary 
should be able to search for a word, and if the word is not found, make some 
suggestions for the misspelled word. The suggestions should come from the list 
of words in the dictionary.

The class should be used to create a program that will perform a spell check on 
the contents of a file. For example, if the file contained this text:

I have a dpg that can run very fast.

the program should indicate that there is a misspelled word, dpg, and offer some 
suggestions of what to replace that word with.

Think about the cause of misspelled words when typing on a keyboard. Misspellings 
are often caused by either a typo or the author simply not knowing the correct 
spelling. A typo is defined as mistyping a single letter. In the example above, 
the letter 'p' is next to the letter 'o' on the keyboard, I consider this a typo- 
I typed the wrong key even though I knew how to spell the word.

If I don't know how to spell a word I usually can come pretty close:

I will recieve a corect copy next week.

Here I misspelled two words, but I came pretty close to getting the spelling 
correct, that is, many of the letters are correct and in the proper order.

Think about ways to suggest words for those that were misspelled. If the user 
made a typo how would you make good suggestions? If the word didn't have typos, 
but was misspelled think about how you could make suggestions.

Here is a (not so great) example of what I am looking for in the output:

Welcome to the SpellCheck program!

The contents of the file are:

I will recieve a corect copy next week.

recieve is misspelled
Here are some suggestions:
receive
record
even
evening
event
ever
every

corect is misspelled
Here are some suggestions:
corn
corner
correct
