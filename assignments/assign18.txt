Write a program to determine how much tape is needed by a pro hockey team. A roll of hockey tape is 100 ft long. On average each player needs 60 inches of tape for each stick. Every player has three sticks. There are 20 skaters on the team. Create variables for each of these aspects of a team and then have the program print out how many rolls of tape the equipment manager should bring to a game.

Next, change some of the values (like changing the average amount each player uses per stick to 70 inches) and run the program again.
