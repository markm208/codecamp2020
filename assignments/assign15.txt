Write a program that will print a calendar for January. The calendar output is determined by the day that January 1st falls on. 

The format of your calendar should be very similar to the example below. 

       January
 S  M  T  W  T  F  S
---------------------
          1  2  3  4
 5  6  7  8  9 10 11
12 13 14 15 16 17 18
19 20 21 22 23 24 25
26 27 28 29 30 31

In this run of the program the first day of January is Wednesday. I would suggest having a variable to hold a number between 0-6 for each of the days of the week (0 for Sunday, 1 for Monday, 2 for Tuesday, and so on). In this case the value would stored in the variable is 3 for Wednesday.

The program has to print the heading, some number of blanks before printing the day numbers, and then the 31 days in January.

You can print the days with loops and two dimensional arrays. I would create a two dimensional array to hold the days. There are seven days in a week and there can be as many as six rows in a January.
