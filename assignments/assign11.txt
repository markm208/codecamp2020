Write a program that will calculate the sum of the squares from 1 up to and including that number. 

For example if the requested value was 5 then the sum of the squares for the numbers one through five would be (1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25) = 55.

Create a variable to hold the ending value (5 in this example). Then create a loop counter variable that will control a loop to move through the values starting at 1.

You will need another variable to hold the running sum of all the squared values. After the loop is complete display the sum of the squares.
