Create a class that represents a date (with a month, day, and year).

The class should have a constructor that takes a value for the month, day, and year. Verify that this is a valid date before setting the values.

Include two methods to print the date like this:

printShort() "11/5/2004"
printLong() "November 5, 2004"

Then create a few dat objects in a main() function and print them out.

Finally, create a method called compare() that returns a -1 if one date comes before another, 0 if they are the same date, and a +1 if one date comes after another.

Use this method (and its return value) to print which of two dates comes first.
