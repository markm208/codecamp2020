Write a program that has an array of jersey numbers for a hockey team like this:

let jerseyNumbers = [45, 57, 9, 31, 56, 78, 31];

Next, use it to determine if a requested jersey number is free or not.

//is this jersey number available??
let requestedNumber = 30;

The program should display whether the requested jersey number is available or not.

if the jersey number is NOT available count how many jersey numbers in the array are above it and how many are below it.
