Write a program to determine if one date comes after another. 

The program will have variables for two sets of dates. 

Next, the program will determine if the first date comes before, is equal to, or comes after.

Here is a sample run of the program:
First month: 2
First day: 21
First year: 2012
 
Second month: 2
Second day: 22
Second year: 2011
 
The first date comes after the second.
